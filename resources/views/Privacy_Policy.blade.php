            Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA), aims to protect personal data in information and communications systems both in the government and the private sector. The DPA created the National Privacy Commission (NPC) which is tasked to monitor its implementation. It covers the processing of personal information and sensitive personal information and sets, as its basic premise, the grant of direct consent by a data subject before data processing of personal information be allowed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-century">
            The law requires all government and private entities or organizations processing personal data to establish policies, and implement measures and procedures to ensure and guarantee the safety and security of personal data under their control or custody, thereby upholding an individual's data privacy rights. In addition, they are required to implement reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data against natural dangers such as accidental loss or destruction, and human dangers such as unlawful access, fraudulent misuse, unlawful destruction, alteration, and contamination.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-century">
            To inform its personnel and data subjects of such measures, all agencies are expected to produce a Privacy Manual. The Manual serves as a guide or handbook for ensuring the compliance of an organization or entity with the DPA, its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and other relevant issuances of the National Privacy Commission (NPC). It also encapsulates the privacy and data protection protocols that need to be observed and carried out within the organization for specific circumstances (e.g., from collection to destruction), directed toward the fulfillment and realization of the rights of the data subjects.
